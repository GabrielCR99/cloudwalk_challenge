# cloudwalk_challenge

A Flutter project to show a list of Pictures of the day from NASA famouse API (APOD).
To access it, you need the api_key, which is very easy to get, just sign up [here](https://api.nasa.gov/#signup)
It saves the first 20 pictures in the cache, using SharedPreferences as an "Offline DB"
